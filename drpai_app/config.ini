# YOLO DRP-AI Detection — Runtime Configuration
#
# Place this file next to the binary to override compile-time defaults.
# Uncomment a line (remove #) to override that parameter.
#
# Priority: CLI flags > config.ini > compile-time defaults (define.h)

# --- Detection Thresholds ---
# conf_threshold = 0.50
# nms_threshold = 0.45
# max_detections = 1

# --- Camera ---
# camera_device = /dev/video0
# camera_width = 640
# camera_height = 480
# warmup_frames = 8

# --- Model ---
# model_dir = model

# --- Display ---
# display_mode = wayland

# --- DRP-AI Frequency ---
# drp_max_freq = 2
# drpai_freq = 1
#
# DRP core:  2=420MHz  3=315MHz  4=252MHz  5=210MHz  127=9.8MHz(min)
# AI-MAC:    1=1GHz    2=1GHz    3=630MHz  4=420MHz  5=315MHz  127=10MHz(min)
#
# Higher frequency = faster inference but more power.
# Reference working values: drp_max_freq=2, drpai_freq=5

# --- Threading ---
# wait_time = 1000
#
# Thread polling interval in microseconds (default 1000 = 1ms).
# Lower = more responsive but more CPU usage.
